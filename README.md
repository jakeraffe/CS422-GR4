## 1. Please make sure you are in the dev branch and that you do a ```git pull``` before making any changes (otherwise you will have to deal with merge conflicts). Navigate to the ```/frontend``` folder. You must run ```yarn install``` to install all packages and dependencies before testing your code.

## 2. In order to see the changes you make, go to ```/frontend/App.js``` and change the '/' route to the page you are working on. For example, if I wanted to work on the LearnPage I would change it to:
```
App.js
<Route exact path="/">
    <LearnPage/>
</Route>
```
## To start the program and see it in the browser, make sure you are in the frontend/ folder and run ```yarn start```.
## 3. There is a ```Pages.css``` file in the pages folder that will allow you to edit the css of whatever page you are working on.
