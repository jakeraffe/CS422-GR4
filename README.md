## 1. Please make sure you are in the dev branch and navigate to the ```/frontend``` folder. You must run ```yarn install``` to install all packages and dependencies before testing your code.

## 2. In order to see the changes you make, go to ```/frontend/App.js``` and change the '/' route go to the page you are working on. For example, if I wanted to work on the LearnPage I would change it to:
```
<Route exact path="/">
    <LearnPage/>
</Route>
```
